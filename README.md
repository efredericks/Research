[Opt out of this research study](#17.-opt-out)

## 1.TITLE

Minimizing Attack Envelopes for Publicly-Advertised Meetings

## 2. RESEARCHERS

PI: Erik Fredericks

Research Assistant: Morgan Hamlin

Advisor: Mary Nuznov

## 3. PURPOSE

Researchers at GVSU have developed a program that scans Twitter for insecure Zoom meetings.  Your meeting was identified as being insecure, and you were notified of this in an effort to help you decide if a password is needed for your Zoom meeting.  We hope that will limit Zoom-bombing and other potential harassment during your meeting.

## 4. PROCEDURES

### Participant procedures:		

Participant receives a notification that they may have inadvertently posted an insecure meeting link on public social media.  The participant will have the option to "opt-out" of future contact via a clickable link.

* Time required for each procedure: **Less than one minute**

*	Are procedures experimental? **Yes**

* Out of pocket costs for participants: **None**

## 5.RISKS 

Electronic data will be collected and/or stored for this research project. As with any use of electronic means to store data, there exists a minimal risk that data could be lost or stolen.

We will only store:

1. The total number of insecure links detected

2. Usernames in the event that the user wishes to "opt-out" of future surveys

We will not store meeting IDs or links to meetings, only occurrences.

## 6. POTENTIAL BENEFITS TO YOU 

The main potential benefit comes from the notification that you posted a possibly insecure meeting.  This benefit can help prevent your meeting from harassment by those not invited to the meeting.

## 7. POTENTIAL BENEFITS TO SOCIETY

The anticipated benefits to society are a reduction in online harassment.

## 8. VOLUNTARY PARTICIPATION
