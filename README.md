	Minimizing Attack Envelopes for Publicly-Advertised Meetings

<font color = "red">2.	<b>RESEARCHERS</b></font>

    PI: Erik Fredericks

    Research Assistant: Morgan Hamlin

    Advisor: Mary Nuznov

<font color = "red">3.	<b>PURPOSE</b></font>

	This research study will generate a program to scan public social media posts for insecure meeting links (e.g., Zoom, Meet, etc.) and notify the original author that they 	   may have inadvertently posted a meeting fully open to the public, with the intent being to reduce online harassment of individuals.

	<b>Research questions:</b>

	RQ1: Can a program (i.e., bot) successfully discover insecure online meetings?

	RQ2: Can the bot successfully notify the author that their meeting is insecure?

4.	<b>PROCEDURES</b>

	Participant procedures:		

	Participant recieves a notification that they may have inadvertently posted an insecure  meeting link on public social media.  The participant will have the  option to 	"opt-out"  of future contact via a clickable link.
		

	Time required for each procedure	-	Less than one minute

	Are procedures experimental?	        -	Yes

	Out of pocket costs for participants:	-	None

5.	<b>RISKS </b>

	Electronic data will be collected and/or stored for this research project. As with any use of electronic means to store data, there exists a minimal risk that data could 	  be lost or stolen.

	We will only store:
	
	1) The total number of insecure links detected
	
	2) Usernames in the event that the user wishes to "opt-out" of future surveys

	We will not store meeting IDs or links to meetings, only occurrences.

6.	<b>POTENTIAL BENEFITS TO YOU </b>

	The main potential benefit comes from the notification that you posted a possibly insecure meeting.  This benefit can help prevent your meeting from harassment by those 	 not invited to the meeting.

7.	<b>POTENTIAL BENEFITS TO SOCIETY</b>

	The anticipated benefits to society are a reduction in online harassment.
